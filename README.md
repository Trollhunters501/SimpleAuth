# SimpleAuth 2.x

By @Shoghicp

[![Poggit Release](https://poggit.pmmp.io/shield.approved/SimpleAuth)](https://poggit.pmmp.io/p/SimpleAuth)

#### IMPORTANT
You no longer need to set "hack login" and "hack register" perms with SimpleAuthHelper.

To use account linking you must also update the database if you use MySQL or SQLite:

MySQL:

* `ALTER TABLE simpleauth.simpleauth_players ADD linkedign VARCHAR(16);`

SQLITE:

* `ALTER TABLE simpleauth.simpleauth_players ADD linkedign TEXT;`


Plugin for PocketMine-MP that prevents people from impersonating an account, requiring registration and login when connecting.

## What's New?

## Commands


* `/login <password>`
* `/register <password>`
* `/unregister <password>` (TODO)
* `/link <otherIGN> <otherpassword>`
* `/unlink`
* For Console: `/unlink <playerIGN>`
* For OPs: `/simpleauth <command: help|unregister> [parameters...]` (TODO)
